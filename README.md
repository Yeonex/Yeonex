### Yeonex

Just a guy on a mission to level up his craft and have a blast doing it! I enjoy creating fun and unique projects, constantly soaking up new knowledge and skills along the way. But why you ask? Because I'm on a quest to whip up some seriously kickass software!!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - Netflix ðŸ˜² ( Nextjs learning project)
  - Self-performance assessment tool (Electron, potentially a bad choice)
  - Notepad ( Rust learning project)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Rust
  - Nextjs

âš¡ Fun facts:
  - Stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/yeonexz). I do dev streams from time to time
  - I make some content on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeirSoma8mCzQyzrtAAFeLA)
  - I enjoy fencing ðŸ¤º
  - Tomb Raider III is my first-ever game
